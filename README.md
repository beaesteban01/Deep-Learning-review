# Deep-Learning-review
Review of the basis of Deep Learning and the main techniques, algorithms and appilcations for the MLLB and PDRL subject of the MUIT
### Practical experimentation with the Font-type recognition task through 
-  Convolutional neural networks: simple CNN and VGG16
-  Recurrent neural networks: simple RNN and LSTM 
-  Transfer learning: using ResNet pretrained model
